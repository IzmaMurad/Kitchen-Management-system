# Kitchen-Management-system
This project simulates a busy kitchen environment where multiple chefs compete for shared resources (like stoves, knives, and chopping boards) to prepare meals. The simulation demonstrates concurrent programming concepts in C, including thread synchronization, resource management, and deadlock prevention.
